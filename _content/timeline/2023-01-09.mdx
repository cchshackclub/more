Hey there! Here's what we're going to be doing today:

1. Everyone is going to sign up for [Winter Wonderland](https://hackclub.com/winter/). It takes place between February 14 - 24, which means you would work on part of it during the spring break - but we can have a meeting where everyone brings in some of their stuff and demos what they're building + get help! This involves opening another PR (pull request) in GitHub and doing some research on what equipment you're going to need. Seriously, you guys can even team up - people are building custom keyboards, LED cubes, combining their budgets to build a PC, freakin' Iron Man helmets - check out all the cool projects [here](https://github.com/hackclub/winter)!
2. Everyone who has gone through the Sprig workshop is going to comment in the Google Classroom with what game they're going to make! If you don't have any ideas, I've included ideas in [today's walkthrough](/walkthroughs/01-09-2023.mdx).
3. Last but not least - anyone who hasn't started with or finished the Sprig workshop - I'll keep working on that with you guys!

**Signing up for Slack is another very important thing we need to do.** Everyone's going to go home and add their Google Account to their Chromebooks, which should then allow you guys to sign up for Slack while we're running a club meeting. Let me know if there are any problems!

Some other news:

-   I got some new stickers!
-   I'm going to try and finish my Sprig game this week so that I can bring in a Sprig to show you guys next week. You get a whole kit - it looks like this:
