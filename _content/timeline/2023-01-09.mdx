Hey there! Here's what we're going to be doing to today:

1. Everyone is going to sign up for [Winter Wonderland](https://hackclub.com/winter/). It takes place between Feburary 14 - 24, which means you would work on part of it during the spring break - but we can have a meeting where everyone brings in some of their stuff and demos what they're building + get help! This involves opening another PR (pull request) in GitHub and doing some research on what equipment you're going to need. Seriously, you guys can even team up - people are building custom keyboards, LED cubes, combining their budgets to build a PC, freakin' Iron Man helmets - check out all the cool projects [here](https://github.com/hackclub/winter)!
2. Everyone who has gone through the Sprig workshop is going to fill out a form with what game they're going to make! If you don't have any idea, I've included ideas in [today's walkthrough](/walkthroughs/01-09-2023.mdx).
3. Last but not least - anyone who hasn't started with or finished the Sprig workshop - I'll keep working on that with you guys!

**Signing up for the Slack is another very important thing we need to do.** Everyone's going to go home and add their Google Account to their Chromebooks, which should then allow you guys to sign up for Slack while we're running a club meeting. Let me know if there are any problems!

Some other news:

-   I got some new stickers!
-   I'm going to try and finish my Sprig game this week so that I can bring in a Sprig to show you guys next week. You get a whole kit - it looks like this:
