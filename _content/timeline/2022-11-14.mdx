We're running a meeting in room 322 again! This time, I'm going to switch things up a bit - we're going to be building games for the Sprig console! Sprig is a gaming console built by members of HC - it's built with the Raspberry Pi Pico ([https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)) and anybody who builds a game for it can get a console, which you can use to play games on or repurpose and take apart! For more info and to play some games built by other Hack Clubbers, check out this link: [https://sprig.hackclub.com/](https://sprig.hackclub.com/)

We're going to learn how to build a basic game for the Sprig together (I don't know anything about it either), and then we'll each build a game (or more) over the next three weeks or so! At least, that's the plan.

Also, I started a playlist here: [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3APoczNOrVwbAVeYRWGhyf](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3APoczNOrVwbAVeYRWGhyf). Please tell me what to include! I have been told by people that I have horrible taste in music, so do not trust me to put together a good playlist.
