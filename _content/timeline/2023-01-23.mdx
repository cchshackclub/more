Hey y'all! We're going to be running another HC meeting today in, of course, room 322. I thought it would be nice for us to take a break from Sprig (personally, I'm almost finished with a Sprig game so I'll hopefully get to bring in a console next week or the week after to show you guys) because people are having trouble with it, so I thought we could learn JavaScript by building Tic-Tac-Toe! Hopefully the code we've written in Sprig will make more sense after today. (Let me know if you're building a game with Sprig! I absolutely want to see it. Email me all hours of the day if you need help.)

Other news. PRs for Winter Wonderland closed a few days ago. Did you guys submit anything? Let me know! I'm going to be turning my bike into an electric bike, which I think is super cool!

-   HC just had an AMA with [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://dhh.dk), who is one of the coolest people in programming! He built Ruby on Rails, runs two companies, and as a racing driver, won a bunch of European racing competitions. Check out his AMA! I'm thinking of putting these AMAs on whenever we're working on our independent projects.
-   Hack Club has a puzzle for you! I'm considering doing this in an HC meeting (they're shipping some posters to me hopefully) but it's at [stablequarters.org](https://stablequarters.org/). It's a whole thing and will probably take you down a rabbit hole and lots of Googling. Also, if you solve it, you get a mystery something shipped to you in the mail :)

I have one last question - **IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO WITH PROGRAMMING**? Let me know and I can totally run a meeting on it (whatever you want... building a game, working with ChatGPT, building a chat app... whatever's fun for you!)
