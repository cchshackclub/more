It's another Monday, so we'll be running a meeting in room 322! We've started working on our Sprig games; I'm in the process of writing a cheatsheet that's going to explain the Sokoban game we created line by line so you guys can understand it better.

If you weren't here last week, that's okay! I can go over the steps to finish your games one by one, and then you can start building your games! Some useful resources include:

-   Open up the Sprig editor, and then click on Open Help. Each of the Sprig functions (functions are just pieces of code that have been written for you, like setMap for setting a map) are explained so you can use them.
-   Check out this workshop for building a Dodger style game! [https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/tree/main/workshops/sprig_dodge](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/tree/main/workshops/sprig_dodge)
-   /workshops/sprig_dodge 
    If you find a game that you like, check out the source code in the editor! There's lots of useful things to be learned, even if you copy + paste (well, copy + paste isn't the best thing to do, type it in line by line maybe) code from another game. For example, some of the games have a scrolling map mechanism that allows the player to move around a map. How cool is that?
-   Sprig is based on JavaScript, a programming language that is used on the web. If you're interested in learning how to JavaScript, check out this book: [https://pepa.holla.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/JavaScript-for-Kids.pdf](https://pepa.holla.cz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/JavaScript-for-Kids.pdf) It's a pretty fun read - you'll learn how to build Find the Buried Treasure, Hangman, and Snake!
-   Ask me! I can help.
-   If you have any questions, join the #sprig channel on Slack! There, you can talk about anything related to Sprig. (Side note: if you need help with Slack, just ask me!)

Last but not least, HC news this week:

-   To make Epoch ([https://epoch.hackclub.com/](https://epoch.hackclub.com/)) more of a global event, HC is hosting mini Epochs in different places, including the Bay Area, Austin, and near us, Vermont at the HC HQ! If you forgot, Epoch is a hackathon (social coding event) where you can learn and build cool projects with other people, and get free food, swag, and other goodies. More info about the Vermont Epoch here: [https://epochvt.hackclub.com/](https://epochvt.hackclub.com/) It's on December 30 and lasts from 10 - 8.
-   Also, other places to look for hackathons if you're interested: [https://hackathons.hackclub.com/](https://hackathons.hackclub.com/), [https://devpost.com/](https://devpost.com/), and [https://mlh.io/seasons/2023/events](https://mlh.io/seasons/2023/events)

**And I have a couple of questions:**

-   Do you guys think it would be useful if I created a website to hold all the stuff we've been doing?
-   What games are you guys creating? I'm creating a Candy Crush game, but I suck at making art. Do any of you guys want to help me with the art?
-   What kind of pizza do you guys like? I'm looking at MLH Pizza Fund ([https://news.mlh.io/gather-in-person-again-with-the-mlh-pizza-fund-10-12-2022](https://news.mlh.io/gather-in-person-again-with-the-mlh-pizza-fund-10-12-2022)) because I kind of want to do something for our last meeting before the holidays.
