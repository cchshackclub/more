Since it's the last meeting of the year, we're having a pizza party! Here's what we're going to be doing today. I've decided to try out slotting everything into times:

-   2:15 - 2:30: Everybody's going to be doing a different thing. I'll be helping people out with the Sprig workshop if they haven't finished it yet. Other people will be getting started with [this walkthrough](/walkthroughs/newcomers.mdx) (eventually everyone will get this done), and then working on a holiday card!
-   3:00 - 3:15: Everyone's going to demo what they've done in Hack Club so far (if they want to)! If you've created a website, show it off! If you're working on a Sprig game, tell the rest of the club what your game's about!

I don't think we'll finish the holiday card during the meeting, but I will have it deployed by the end of Monday! Then, you guys can share it with whoever you want to share it with.

Other news:

-   Sign up for [Winter Wonderland](https://hackclub.com/winter/)! You'll get $250 to build a hardware project. This can be anything from a mechanical keyboard to a Raspberry Pi computer to a drone. Maybe something even more ambitious!
