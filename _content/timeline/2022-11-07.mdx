Hey, we're going to be running a meeting today! Let's meet in room 322. We'll be working on the same thing - building websites.

What are you guys planning to build for your websites? Just share the link to your Replit below. And if you're not there yet, it's okay! Please let me know if the workshop is too hard for you - I'll be more than happy to help! Plus, if you want to add stuff like fonts, columns, etc. to your website, let me know.

Have no ideas on what kind of website to build? Also let me know, I've got a couple of ideas!

News of the week:

-   HC is hosting another AMA this Friday, 4 - 7! This time it's with George Hotz, who built [https://comma.ai/](https://comma.ai/), which basically allows people to turn their car into a self-driving one. Here's a video on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmBfgOanCyk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmBfgOanCyk)
-   I don't remember if I told you guys about this, but do you know what a hackathon is? Google it, and check out [https://hackathons.hackclub.com/](https://hackathons.hackclub.com/) and [https://mlh.io/seasons/2023/events](https://mlh.io/seasons/2023/events). Maybe we'll have one in-person nearby in the future.
