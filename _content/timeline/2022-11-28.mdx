Hey, we'll be running a meeting today in room 322! We're going to finish our Sprig games, and then we can probably start building our own games next week! Exciting. Other news:

-   HC is running another ten-days-in-public challenge again at [https://events.hackclub.com/10-days-in-public-1/](https://events.hackclub.com/10-days-in-public-1/)! Basically, you choose to work on or learn something (it doesn't even have to be related to programming!) If you make it all ten days, you get free fudge from The Vermont Country Store in Shelburne, VT. Y'all should sign up! Just head over to Slack, join the #10-days-in-public and #hq channel, and tell everybody what you'll be doing. (You can do anything - maybe finish a Sprig game, finish your website design, learn a programming language... anything! I'm going to try and finish the design for a project I've been procrastinating on.)
