Hey guys! We'll be running a meeting today in room 322. I'll help some of you guys with the Sprig workshop, and the rest of you guys can keep working on your games! **Also, please take a look at the questions I asked in the December 5 post.**

In the meantime, what kind of games are you guys working on? Or leave a "IDK" if you don't know yet.
