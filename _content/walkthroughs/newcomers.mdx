New to Hack Club? Here's an intro workshop on joining Hack Club.

The first question, of course, is: **What is Hack Club**? According to Hack Club, it's made up of "23,294 teen hackers from around the world who code together"... including you!

When we talk about hacking, we don't mean actual hacking. Actually, hacking is a very broad term. When we hack, we build something cool, using only resources from the Internet, help from other hackers, and of course, cool tech like 3D printers, etc.

Hack Club allows you to interact with other hackers. You can:

1. Connect with other teenage coders
2. Build open source (open to the public for everyone to contribute to) learning tools
3. Gather IRL with other makers

Basically, lots of cool stuff! I'd also like to point out #3. Hack Club has done all sorts of cool events from [Assemble](https://assemble.hackclub.com) to [Epoch](https://epoch.hackclub.com) to [Winter Wonderland](https://hackclub.com/winter/). Explore the site when you can, there's so much to do!

## Let's get you started!

Okay, now let's actually get you set up with Hack Club. The first thing you'll want to do is sign up for [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/?continent=North%20America), where you can talk to other teenage hackers.

Once you've signed up and gone through the onboarding process, you should have access to a bunch of channels (think of channels as discussion channels where you can discuss different topics), including `#welcome`. Here, introduce yourself to Hack Club! It can be anything from a simple, "Hi, I'm" to "Here's what I do".

Now, we're going to sign up for [Hack Club's scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/about). It's what it sounds like - a scrapbook where you can post updates about what you're working on, in this club and in your free time! Take a picture of your introduction in `#welcome` (let me know if you have trouble with this), and then head over to the `#scrapbook` channel, and post something like: "I'm new to Hack Club!" followed by the screenshot of your introduction.

Once you've got this, a bot called Scrappy should respond, giving you a link to check out your scrapbook. Here's how mine looks like:

To change your scrapbook ID, run `/scrappy-setusername <New ID>` inside Slack, probably in a message to yourself.

Now let's sign up for [Replit](https://replit.com), a tool that lets you code online. Simply head to the website and sign up with your Google account (can be your school or personal). We will use this all the time since we can't really download anything on these computers.

Last but not least, we need to sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com). Out of the things you'll sign up for today, GitHub probably makes the least sense. But it's a place where we can collaborate on code. The more you use it, the more it will make sense. To sign up, simply head to the website, click on sign up, and fill out the necessary info. (Let me know if you have any trouble with this.)

## Adding yourself to the list of members

Now that you've signed up for GitHub, we're going to see how it allows us to collaborate on code. Head over to [https://github.com/cchshackclub/more](https://github.com/cchshackclub/more). This is a **repository**, a code project; specifically, the code in this repository powers this website. Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner (it's next to the "Start" and "Watch" buttons). This basically allows you to create your version of the code.

It should redirect you to a page that looks like this:

![GitHub pull request](/images/newcomers/pull-request.png)

Click "Create fork", and now you should have your own repository, `<your GitHub handle>/more`. You can directly edit this one!

If you explore the files in the repo, you'll see that there's a file called `members.json`. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a way to represent data. The contents of the file will look something like this:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Jianmin Chen",
        "pronouns": "she/her",
        "github": "jianmin-chen",
        "slack": "U03MNFDRSGJ",
        "slackhandle": "jc",
        "scrapbook": "jc",
        "website": "https://jianminchen.com",
        "about": "Most people have trouble calling me by my actual name, so just call me Amanda! I discovered programming by accident when I found a book at my local library (in Brooklyn). I discovered Hack Club this spring (2022)."
    }
]
```

The brackets, `[]`, means that this is a list of data. Each item in the list looks something like this:

```json
{
    "name": "Jianmin Chen",
    "pronouns": "she/her",
    "github": "jianmin-chen",
    "slack": "U03MNFDRSGJ",
    "slackhandle": "jc",
    "scrapbook": "jc",
    "website": "https://jianminchen.com",
    "about": "Most people have trouble calling me by my actual name, so just call me Amanda! I discovered programming by accident when I found a book at my local library (in Brooklyn). I discovered Hack Club this spring (2022)."
}
```

The items are all _separated by commas_. So, to add your info, you'd add this to the bottom of the data:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Jianmin Chen",
        "pronouns": "she/her",
        "github": "jianmin-chen",
        "slack": "U03MNFDRSGJ",
        "slackhandle": "jc",
        "scrapbook": "jc",
        "website": "https://jianminchen.com",
        "about": "Most people have trouble calling me by my actual name, so just call me Amanda! I discovered programming by accident when I found a book at my local library (in Brooklyn). I discovered Hack Club this spring (2022)."
    },
    {
        "name": "Your name",
        "pronouns": "Your pronouns",
        "github": "Your GitHub handle",
        "slack": "Your Slack ID",
        "slackhandle": "Your Slack handle",
        "scrapbook": "Your scrapbook ID",
        "website": "Link to your (Replit) website",
        "about": "About you!"
    }
]
```

<details>
    <summary>Where do I get this information?</summary>* `github`: Your username
    for GitHub! to change your member picture, change your GitHub avatar. * `slack`:
    Your Slack ID. To find this, go to Hack Club Slack, open up your profile (click
    your profile image in the top right corner > Profile), and then click on the
    hamburger menu > Copy member ID. * `slackhandle`: This is your display name on
    Slack. * `scrapbook`: This is your scrapbook ID, which you should have changed
    before. * `website`: If you already created a website with Replit, this is the
    link to that website. Otherwise, **you don't have to add this line**.
</details>

Now let's actually add the data. If you're viewing the file, simply click the little pencil icon above the code, which will take you to a page like this:

![GitHub edit](/images/newcomers/github-edit.png)

Add your info, and then scroll down to where it says "Commit changes". To commit a change means to, well, make a change. "Commit" is just nice terminology. Anyways, in the small text box (where it should say `Create members.json`), add a description of what you just did. It can be something along the lines of "Add myself to list of members".

Once you've done this, press the green "Commit changes", and the file will be updated!

Of course, this is **your** repo. If you check the [member website](/members), nothing will change. To change it, you need to make a **pull request**. A pull request allows you to ask the owner of some code, "Can I make a change?"

So let's do that. Go back to the main page of your repository. You'll see text that's similar to "This branch is... with cchshackclub/more". We're going to click on the "Contribute" button, and then "Open pull request".

You'll be redirected to a page that looks like this:

![Open pull request](/images/newcomers/open-pull-request.png)

If it says "Able to merge", click on "Create pull request"! (If it doesn't, let me know.)

Of course, just because you open a pull request doesn't mean it actually updates the code of the original repository. After all, it's a _request_, since you don't own/have access to the repo. Once I approve it and **merge** the changes you've made to the original repository, your member info will show up on the website! How cool is that? Make sure to let me know that you've opened a pull request so I can then merge it.

## Done early?

Let me know! I'll either have you work on what we're currently doing or get you to build your first website with [this workshop](https://workshops.hackclub.com/personal_website/).
