Here's what we're going to do today!

1. Sign up for Winter Wonderland
2. Keep working on our Sprig games

> You guys can work on your Sprig games outside of our HC meetings! This is a club that's meant to introduce all of y'all to coding. I'd love to see some of you bring in your Sprig kit. We could assemble them together - that would be super cool!

# Sign up for Winter Wonderland!

## What is Winter Wonderland?

[Here's](https://github.com/hackclub/winter) the official website! Basically, the gist is that Hack Club will give you up to $250 to build your own hardware project. This means you can build anything you dream of. Projects that other Hack Clubbers are building include:

-   Custom PCB keyboards (which, to be honest, I know nothing about, but seems super cool)
-   Iron Man helmets
-   Smart mirrors (you know, like the mirrors that Lulumon has been advertising)
-   DIY drones
-   DIY [3D printers](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer) (imagine having your own 3D printer!)

People are even grouping their budgets togther to build bigger projects like:

-   A budget PC!

If you guys want to build something together, that would be even cooler than working solo :)

To get started, you need to make a PR to [this](https://github.com/hackclub/winter) GitHub repo, which is located at [https://github.com/hackclub/winter](https://github.com/hackclub/winter). Most of you should know how to make PRs from last week when you guys added your information to `members.json` - if not, I'll get you guys set up with that!

If you scroll down to the README (a README is just a description of a project), it will explain what to do. I'll summarize it here.

1. Fork the repo! This is what we did last week.
2. Create a new file with your GitHub username, `YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.md`.

Last week, we only discussed editing a file. To create a new file, it's actually very easy. Go to your forked repo, and click on the "Add file > Create new file" button, like so:

![Add file button](/images/2023-01-09/new-file.png)

You'll get to a page like this:

![Create file](/images/2023-01-09/create-file.png)

Fill in "Name your file..." with `YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.md` (if you don't know your GitHub username, go to the top right corner, and click on your profile image - it will say "Signed in as \<YOURGITHUBUSERNAME\>"), and copy paste this template inside the textarea:

```md
---
name: "@yourGitHubUsername"
project: "Your Project Name Here"

# Project Name

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.

| Product         | Supplier/Link                         | Cost   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Pack of wires   | https://www.adafruit.com/product/1957 | $1.95  |
| 1.8"LCD display | https://www.adafruit.com/product/358  | $19.95 |
| Total           |                                       | $21.90 |
```

So this is actually [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). It's a lightweight text language that lets you add formatting elements to plain text. For example, `**` makes text bold, like `**bold**`. You'll be writing your PR in Markdown, so please read [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) reference guide to understand more about it.

From here, just fill out each section! The sections you'll really need to do some research on are "Plan" and "Budget". Feel free to do some Googling!

If you need help with coming up with an idea, you're too grown up. /jk Use your imagination! If you need help coming up with an idea, ask the people around you - including me!

Once you're done, you have to merge your PR back in. We also did this last week. Go to your forked repo, and click on "Contribute > Open pull request". Please refer to [this](/walkthroughs/newcomers.mdx)

Now you're all done! Keep a watch out - an HC member will check your PR to make sure everything's all good to go, and they'll give you more instructions on what to do next, including ordering getting the money and ordering the stuff! Woohoo!

# Sprig time!

So we'll keep working on our Sprig games. If you've done the workshops and are working on a game, please comment in the Google Classroom so I can gauge everyone's progress! Otherwise, I'll catch up with everyone else! Once again, here are the workshops:

-   [Build your first Sprig game](https://workshops.hackclub.com/sprig_first_game/)
-   [Sprig Dodging Game](https://workshops.hackclub.com/sprig_dodge/)

Have no idea what to build? Here are some ideas:

-   Space Invaders! A spaceship at the bottom of the screen moves left and right to dodge asteroids/aliens falling down the screen. The player has x lives.
-   Tic Tac Toe! Think about how the inputs would work in this case. Maybe we have a grid, and we can use WASD to move through the grid, and then K to choose a spot.
-   Guessing game! Think of Match 2 or 3. Cards are flipped over, you have to choose two matching cards at a time and clear the board.
-   Simon! You have a grid of four colors: red, yellow, green, and blue. The computer generates a random pattern, then plays it for the player, who has to complete the same pattern. Use WASD to choose the color. The game gets faster, of course.


# PLEASE ASK ME FOR HELP! IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE LOGIC FOR THIS STUFF THAT'S COMPLETELY OKAY, JUST LET ME KNOW.
