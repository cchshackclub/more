title: "12/19/2022: Building a holiday card together!"
---

Here's what the final card will look like:

<video controls>
    <source src="/images/holiday-card/holiday-card.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

So cool! Of course, it's pretty hard to build this in one meeting solo, so we're going to work as a team and do different portions.

First up, let's take a look at the starting boilerplate, which is located at [https://replit.com/join/nuqgyrurbt-jianmin-chen](https://replit.com/join/nuqgyrurbt-jianmin-chen). You should be invited to edit the code; if not, let me know.

## Exploring the boilerplate

First let's take a look at the boilerplate. It has a couple of files:

-   `index.html`, the HTML file
-   `index.css`, the styles for our HTML file
-   `index.js`, the JavaScript (it makes the page interactive, like the fireworks you see)
-   `/fonts` contains some fonts for our card

`index.html` looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <base target="_blank" />
        <meta charset="utf-8" />

        <title>Holiday Card | CCHS Hack Club</title>

        <link href="./index.css" rel="stylesheet" />
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tsparticles-preset-fireworks@2/tsparticles.preset.fireworks.bundle.min.js"></script>
        <script src="./index.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="options">
            <!-- Buttons in the bottom right corner -->
        </div>
        <div id="toasts">
            <!-- Toasts (notifications) in the bottom left corner -->
        </div>
        <div id="card">
            <!-- Card -->
            <div id="card-inner">
                <!-- Card content -->
                <div id="front">
                    <!-- Front of card -->
                </div>
                <div id="back">
                    <!-- Back of card -->
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

In the `head`, we link to our stylesheet and our script file. We also link to [`tsparticles`](https://particles.js.org/), a library (code written by other people) that allows us to create our fireworks. This makes the fireworks a million times easier to create, as you'll see later.

Inside our body, we have a bunch of `<div>`s. In case you forgot what a `<div>` is, it's basically sort for "section". So we have different sections:

```
options
toasts
card
    card-inner
        front
        back
```

You'll notice we have a lot of `id="..."`. IRL, an ID is a unique identifier. This is the same in HTML - we use `id` to describe each `<div>`.

Now let's look at the CSS:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: "Better Yesterday";
    src: url("./fonts/BetterYesterday.otf") format("opentype");
}

@font-face {
    font-family: "Better Yesterday";
    font-style: italic;
    src: url("./fonts/BetterYesterdayItalic.otf") format("opentype");
}

@font-face {
    font-family: "Inter";
    font-weight: 200 900;
    src: url("./fonts/Inter.ttf") format("truetype");
}

@font-face {
    font-family: "Inter Tight";
    font-weight: 200 900;
    src: url("./fonts/InterTight.ttf") format("truetype");
}

@font-face {
    font-family: "Staatliches";
    src: url("./fonts/Staatliches.ttf") format("truetype");
}

* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

body,
html {
    background-color: #e9e8e8;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    margin: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    padding: 0;
    height: 100%;
}

#card {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    width: 90vw;
    height: 90vh;
    overflow: auto;
    max-width: 90vw;
    max-height: 90vh;
}
```

All the `font-face` code basically sets up the fonts to get ready for use. We have a couple of fonts:

-   Better Yesterday and Better Yesterday Italic for cursive text
-   Inter and Inter Tight for the letter text
-   Staatliches for the "Happy Holidays! 2022" text

Then, we have `body, html {...}`. This sets styles for the `body` and `html` tag inside the HTML file. We:

-   Change the background color
-   Set `display: flex`, which just means that everything will be determined by columns
    -   This allows us to use `align-items: center;` and `justify-content: center`, which moves our card to the middle of the screen
-   Set margin to 0, so that the entire screen is covered with the background color
-   Set `overflow: hidden` and `height: 100%`, which just means that if the content goes beyond the screen size, then it will be hidden
-   Set padding to 0, so that there is no extra spacing for content inside

When you think about margin and padding, think about a box, with each HTML tag being a tag. Margin is the outside of the box, border is the box itself, padding is the foam padding inside the box, and the children of the tag (any tags inside the tag) is the stuff inside the box.

`index.js` is very short:

```javascript
window.onload = () => {
    // Run code on load
};
```

## Step One

Everything is divided by section! Decide what makes sense. Some things you can do at the same time, other times you guys will have to work together step by step.

### Add buttons in bottom right corner

Adding buttons is very easy. First, inside `<div id="options">`, we going to add the actual buttons:

```html
<div id="options">
    <button class="option-button" id="share-button" title="Share card">
        <svg
            fill-rule="evenodd"
            clip-rule="evenodd"
            stroke-linejoin="round"
            stroke-miterlimit="1.414"
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
            aria-label="share"
            viewBox="0 0 32 32"
            preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"
            fill="currentColor"
            width="32"
            height="32"
            title="share">

                transform="translate(6 9)"></path>
        </svg>
    </button>
</div>
```

We have two buttons. One button is the share button, and the other is the flip button. The `svg` inside these buttons are just images. [SVG](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/vector/svg-file.html) is just another image format, like JPG or PNG.

Now we need to style these buttons with CSS to get them in the bottom right corner. First, we're going to move `<div id="options">` to the bottom right corner:

```css
#options {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 8px;
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 10px;
    right: 10px;
}
```

`position: fixed` makes the location of the `<div>` fixed in one spot, which is 10 pixels from the very bottom and 10px from the very right (`bottom: 10px` and `right: 10px`). The other three lines:

```css
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
gap: 8px;
```

Set the display to `flex` and the `flex-direction` to `column`, which just means that the buttons will be below one another, with a `gap` or spacing of 8 pixels between them.

Now we can style the individual buttons:

```css
.option-button {
    background-color: white;
    color: gray;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    border-radius: 50%;
    width: 40px;
    height: 40px;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    transition: all 0.1s;
}

.option-button:hover {
    color: black;
}
```

If you look at the HTML, you'll notice that each of the buttons, in addition to an `id=""`, have a `class="option-button"`. So while `id` is a unique identifier for each HTML element, **`class` describes the classes that an element belongs to**. In this case, both buttons have the class `option-button`, so they'll both have the same styles. The class selector is `.` (vs. `#` for `id`). If we didn't do it like this, we would have to write the same code... twice.

Now let's actually look at the styles.

-   We set the background color to white, and the text color to gray.
-   We set a shadow of `0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`. The first four values, `0 4px 8px 0` describe the top, right, bottom, left shadow sizes, respectively. The last value, `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`, is the color of the shadow. Color normally is a word, or a hex value (e.g., `#343535`, which uses [hexadecimal](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hexadecimal/all)), or a RGB value (e.g., `rgb(255, 255, 255) = rgb(red, green, blue)` where `red`, `green`, and `blue` all have a max value of 255). In this case, we're using a RGBA value, short for red, green, blue, and alpha (opacity).

*   We set `border: none` to remove the border that comes by default with buttons. We also set `border-radius: 50%`, which basically makes the button round.
*   `cursor: pointer` changes the cursor when you hover over the button.
*   We set `width` and `height` to 40 pixels.
*   We set `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, and `justify-content: center` so that the SVG icon is in the middle of the button.
*   Finally, we set `transition: all 0.1s`, which means that any changes to the style will happen over 0.1 seconds.

This last part is useful because we also include styles for when we hover over the button (`.option-button:hover`). When the user hovers over the button, the text color changes from gray to black. `transition` makes this seem smooth because it's not an instant change, it takes 0.1 seconds to change.

Awesome! Now the buttons should work; when you open the page in a new tab, they should appear in the bottom right corner.

### Make toasts work

For now, let's style the toasts. Here's the HTML for the toasts:

```html
<div id="toasts">
    <div class="toast">
        <p>Copied to clipboard</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

So you'll notice that there's an `<div id="toasts">` surrounding the toasts. We can style this first so it appears in the bottom left corner:

```css
#toasts {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 10px;
    left: 10px;
    z-index: 999;
    width: 100%;
}
```

Once again, we see `position: fixed` and `bottom: 10px` and `left: 10px`. This just ensures that the `div` is in the bottom left corner, 10 pixels from the very bottom and 10 pixels from the very left.

Then, we have `width: 100%`, making the width of the `div` as wide as possible (so text is on one line if possible). We also have `z-index: 999`, which just means that the `div` is going to be above everything else (it won't disappear underneath another `div`).

Now let's style the toast. Here, we'll use a **class** - a set of styles. Why? Because we will have more than one toast; imagine the user clicks the share button and submits the signature form at the same time. So we want to create a set of styles that can be reused:

```css
.toast {
    opacity: 0.9;
    background-color: #fffaf4;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    font-family: "Inter Tight";
    font-size: 0.995rem;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    padding: 0.1rem 1rem;
}
```

-   `opacity: 0.9` sets the opacity of the toast to 0.9, where 0 makes it invisible and 1 makes it fully visible.
-   `background-color: #fffaf4` sets the background color to #fffaf4, which is a hex value (hexadecimal color). It's a light beige kind of color.
-   `box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)` sets a shadow on the toast. The first four values are the top, right, bottom, and left sizes of the shadow, respectively. The last value is the color of the shadow in RGBA (red, green, blue, and alpha - opacity; check the option buttons section for more info).

*   We set `font-family: "Inter Tight"` and `font-size: 0.995rem;`, which basically sets the font of the text and the size. `rem` is a [measurement](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/) used in CSS just like `px` - the only difference is that instead of measuring pixels on the screen, it uses the browser default ro calculate the size (if the browser default font size is 16px, then `1rem = 16px`.)
*   We also set `position: absolute`, `bottom: 0`, and `left: 0`. This means that the toast is at the very bottom and left of `<div id="toasts">`.
*   Finally, we add some padding with `padding: 0.1rem 1rem`. The first value, `0.1rem`, is the top and bottom padding. `1rem` is the left and right padding.

And now you should see a toast appear in the bottom left corner with the text "Copied to clipboard"! We would also like to add a cool animation, where it slides up, waits a couple of moments, and then disappear. CSS lets us do this with [CSS animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations). The code to style the toast ends up looking like this:

```css
@keyframes slide-up {
    0% {
        bottom: -100px;
    }
    20% {
        bottom: 2px;
    }
    30% {
        bottom: 5px;
    }
    40% {
        bottom: 2px;
    }
    50% {
        bottom: 2px;
    }
    60% {
        bottom: 2px;
    }
    70% {
        bottom: 2px;
    }
    80% {
        bottom: 2px;
    }
    90% {
        bottom: 2px;
    }
    100% {
        bottom: -100px;
    }
}

.toast {
    animation: slide-up 3s ease-in-out forwards;
    opacity: 0.9;
    background-color: #fffaf4;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    font-family: "Inter Tight";
    font-size: 0.995rem;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    padding: 0.1rem 1rem;
}
```

Here we have a couple of new things. We don't change the `.toast` class too much, but we add one line of code to it: `animation: slide-up 3s ease-in-out forwards`. This means that we want to run an animation called `slide-up` over 3 seconds. `ease-in-out` makes it a smooth animation, and `forwards` means that after the animation is done, the styles won't reset.

The `slide-up` animation, in fact, is the new code. `@keyframes` refers to a CSS animation. Inside `slide-up`, we say that at 0%, the position of the toast should be -100 pixels from the bottom, which pretty much hides the toast. Then, at 20% - 90%, the toast will slide up to 2 pixels from the bottom. At 100%, the toast will return back to -100px, hiding it again.

Okay, cool! A toast should pop up when you refresh the page.

### Front of the card

For now, the front of the card is going to be pretty basic. Let's just add some text to it:

```html
<div id="front">
    <div id="front-content">
        <div id="happy-holidays">
            <h1>Happy Holidays!</h1>
            <h3>2022</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Inside `<div id="front">`, we create another `<div id="front-content">`, which holds a `<div id="happy-holidays">` which has the actual happy holidays text. Here's how we style it:

```css
#happy-holidays {
    background-color: black;
    color: #fffaf4;
    font-family: "Staatliches", sans-serif;
    font-size: 4rem;
    padding: 2rem;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    z-index: 5;
    text-transform: uppercase;
}

#happy-holidays h1,
#happy-holidays h3 {
    line-height: 0.8;
    margin: 0;
}
```

We've used a lot of the same properties (e.g., `background-color` is a property), so hopefully most of this should make sense. We style `<div id="happy-holidays">` first, and then we style the `h1` and `h3` elements inside using `#happy-holidays h1, #happy-holidays h3 {...}`. There are a couple of new properties though:

-   `text-transform: uppercase;` makes all the text uppercase.
-   `line-height: 0.8;` makes the distance between lines of text smaller to 0.8.

### Make card flip when user clicks button

Okay, before we start working on the back of the card, we need to actually get the card to flip. The first thing we'll do is style the card to get it to flip:

```css
#card-inner {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    transition: transform 0.8s;
    transform-style: preserve-3d;
}

#front,
#back {
    background-color: #fffaf4;
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    backface-visibility: hidden;
    z-index: 999;
}

#back {
    display: flex;
    transform: rotateY(180deg);
}

#back > div {
    flex-basis: 50%;
    overflow: auto;
}
```

Okay, this is a lot to take in, so let's go through it slowly. First, we style `<div id="card-inner">`. We set `position: relative`, so that children inside can have a specific location where the top left corner is going to be the top left corner of the card instead of the screen. Then, we make sure that the width and height are 100%, we set `transition: transform 0.8s` so that the card takes 0.8 seconds to flip, and `transform-style: preserve-3d` so that only the card flips in the 3D space.

The, we style the front and back of the cards with `#front` and `#back`. Both the front and back of the cards will have a background color of `#fffaf4`, and will have a `position` of `absolute`, meaning that it will start in the top left corner of the card. We also make sure that `width: 100%` and `height: 100%` so they take up the full size of the card. `z-index: 999` is used to make sure it goes above everything else (nothing will overlap with it). Finally, `backface-visibility` is set to `hidden` so that when the card is flipped, we won't see the other side.

We also have a couple of styles specific to the back of the card.

-   `display: flex;` and the styles inside `#back > div` divide the back of the card into two columns.
    -   `flex-basis: 50%` is the size of each column: 50% of the total size
    -   `overflow: auto` means that if the content overflows the card, the user can scroll to see the content.
-   `transform: rotateY(180deg)` makes it so the back of the card isn't backwards. Think about it - if the card has two sides, one side would be backwards, so we have to rotate it by 180 degrees so it's not backwards anymore. Don't believe me? Try not using this line!

Of course, we actually have to get the flip button to work. Here's how. Include this in the bottom of the code inside `window.onload` in `index.js`:

```js
document.getElementById("flip-button").addEventListener("click", () => {
    if (
        document.getElementById("card-inner").style.transform ===
        "rotateY(180deg)"
    )
        document.getElementById("card-inner").style.transform = "";
    else
        document.getElementById("card-inner").style.transform =
            "rotateY(180deg)";
});
```

Here, we're adding adding a event listener to check when `<button id="flip-button">` is clicked. When it gets clicked, we check which side of the card we're on. If we're on the back side, that means we've flipped the card 180 degrees (`if document.getElementById9("card-inner").style.transform === "rotateY(180deg)"`), so we're going to reset that. Otherwise, we're going to flip the card 180 degrees. Using `rotateY` instead of `rotateX` or `rotate` makes it so that the card only rotates vertically.

Okay, now the card can be flipped!

### Back of the card: Left side

Now let's work on the back of the card. The first thing we'll do is the left side, which is where the warm, heartfelt text will be placed.

```html
<div id="message">
    <a href="https://cchs.hackclub.com" target="_blank">
        <img
            style="width: 200px"
            src="https://assets.hackclub.com/flag-orpheus-top.svg" />
    </a>
    <div class="prose">
        <p>
            At most schools, clubs are required to have an adult advisor
            (usually an employee at the school) to manage the paperwork for the
            club, help find a space for it, and supervise meetings. This person
            should have a good relationship with your school's administration;
            if something goes wrong, they'll be the one to back you up.
        </p>
        <p>
            To start, it's best to look for people who are interested in
            programming and teaching it to students. This may include CS
            teachers, IT admins (this connection can be really handy when trying
            to access blocked sites for your club meetings), and teachers of
            tech-related classes. You may also be interested in talking to
            people in your school's math or science departments, or even any
            non-STEM teacher who you like. It shouldn't be required for your
            advisor to have programming experience as long your club is totally
            student-run.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a last resort, one option could also be to reach out to
            individuals outside your school, if your school allows for them to
            supervise clubs. This is what I ended up doing, but in order to get
            approved by your school district, you may need to find someone who
            works at your school to formally submit an application.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
```

_Yes, I have put some random text. We probably need to replace this with warm, heartfelt text. I probably will have an AI do this, lol._

This belongs inside `<div id="back">`. Inside, we have an image (the Hack Club flag) inside a link (the `<a>` tag). This way, when the user clicks on the image, they'll be redirected to our Hack Club website. `target="_blank"` opens the website in a new tab.

That was very easy. Here's the CSS to style the text:

```css
#message .prose {
    font-family: "Inter Tight", sans-serif;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    padding: 0rem 3rem 1rem 3rem;
}
```

This simply styles the prose/text inside `<div id="message">`. The font we use is Inter Tight, with a font size of 1.5rem (`rem` is just another form of measurement; check the above sections for an explanation of what `rem` is). We also add padding to the text:

-   No padding on top - `0rem`
-   `3rem` of padding on the right
-   `1rem` of padding on the bottom
-   `3rem` of padding on the left

### Back of the card: Right side text

If you look at the back of the card right now, it'll look a bit wierd, because there isn't a second column. To fix that, we'll add the second column now:

```html
<div id="message">
    <!-- Code from before -->
    ...
</div>
<div id="info">
    <div id="signatures"></div>
    <div id="to">
        <h1>
            <span class="prefix" style="font-size: 1.5rem">TO:</span>
            You!
        </h1>
        <hr />
        <hr />
        <hr />
    </div>
</div>
```

This time, the second column has `id="info"`. Inside, there are two `<div>`s:

-   One with `id="signatures"`. This will hold the signatures later on.
-   One with `id="to"`. This will be the "To: You!" text. Inside here, we have an `h1` tag, containing a `span` tag with a class of `.prefix`. A `span` tag essentially lets us add special classes, IDs, etc. to text inside text. This will be the prefix text, "TO:", which is smaller than the "You!" text.

We also have four `<hr/>`s. `hr` is short for horizontal break and it's basically a line. This creates the illusion of an unfilled postcard, as you can see in the video.

Okay, here are the styles:

```css
#info {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-between;
    font-family: "Better Yesterday", cursive;
    font-size: 3rem;
    margin: 2rem 0;
    padding: 2rem;
    border-left: 1px solid;
}

#info h1 {
    border-bottom: 1px solid;
    margin-bottom: 0;
    width: 100%;
}

#signatures {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 14px;
}

#signatures p {
    line-height: 0;
    margin-bottom: 0;
}

.prefix {
    color: gray;
    font-family: "Staatliches";
    font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```

### Back of the card: Signature form

Okay, let's add the signature form after the "To: You" text. Here's the HTML:

```html
<div id="info">
    <!-- Code from before -->
    <form id="sign">
        <input
            autocomplete="off"
            type="text"
            name="name"
            placeholder="Sign this card!"
            required />
        <button type="submit">Sign!</button>
    </form>
</div>
```

We use the `form` tag, which holds the choices in a form. Inside here, we have two elements:

-   An `input` element. This is the text box where the user will type in their name.
    -   `autocomplete="off"` turns off autocomplete
    -   `type="text"` makes this a text box. For example, you can use `type="password"` for a password box.
    -   `name="name"` is the name for this input box.
    -   `placeholder="Sign this card!"` is the placeholder for when the user hasn't typed anything yet
    -   `required` makes this input required, so the user can't turn it in if theyhaven't filled it out yet
-   A `button` element. This is the submit button.
    -   `type="submit"` turns this button into a submit button.

Of course, we haven't done the styling yet, so this form doesn't look particularly great right now. Let's spruce up the styles:

```css
#sign {
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    border: 1px solid #e2e8f0;
    font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    font-weight: 500;
    padding: 7px 7px 7px 14px;
    border-radius: 25px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    letter-spacing: -1px;
}

#sign input {
    background-color: transparent;
    border: none;
    color: black;
    letter-spacing: inherit;
    font-family: inherit;
    font-size: inherit;
    font-weight: inherit;
    outline: none;
}

#sign button {
    background-color: #67c6b6;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 20px;
    color: #fffaf4;
    letter-spacing: inherit;
    font-family: inherit;
    font-size: inherit;
    font-weight: inherit;
    padding: 7px 35px;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

Here, we're styling the form, then the input inside the form (`#sign input`), and then the button inside the form (`#sign button`). Hopefully some of this looks familiar. When we style the form, we:

-   Add a border
-   Add a shadow
-   Add some padding
-   Change the font/font size
-   Use `display: flex` so that the input and button show up to next to each other instead of on separate rows. Then, we use `justify-content: space-between" so that the input and button are at separate ends of the form (there is space between them).

When we style the input, we:

-   Revert the styles the browsers give `input`s. This involves removing the `border`,

## Step Two

### Add fireworks

Earlier, I mentioned that someone else already wrote the code for us when it comes to the fireworks. In programming, we typically package our code into libraries, so that everyone can use them. In our case, we're using a package called [`ts-particles`](https://particles.js.org/). All we need to get the fireworks to work is to add a `<div id="tsparticles">` to our HTML, obviously on the front of the card:

```html
<div id="front">
    <div id="front-content">
        <div id="happy-holidays">
            <h1>Happy Holidays!</h1>
            <h3>2022</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="tsparticles"></div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Now in our JavaScript, at the top of `window.onload`, we can run the following code:

```javascript
tsParticles.load("tsparticles", {
    preset: "fireworks"
});
```

The library gives us a variable called `tsParticles`, which let's us `load` a preset. In our case, the preset is fireworks, but they have a bunch of other cool [ones](https://particles.js.org/samples/index.html) you can check out.

And now the fireworks should work! How cool is that?

### Create toasts on the fly

Now that we have the CSS for toasts working, we want to be able to generate toasts on the fly:

-   When the user clicks on the share button, we want a toast to pop up that says "Copied to clipboard"
-   When the user submits the signature form, we want a toast to pop up that says "Awesome! Now send this card off to someone!"

Let's write a **function** - a block of code - to create a toast. It will look like this, at the top of the file:

```javascript
const createNewToast = msg => {
    let toast = document.createElement("div");
    toast.classList.add("toast");
    toast.innerHTML = `<p>${msg}</p>`;
    document.getElementById("toasts").appendChild(toast);
};
```

So there's a couple of things to note. First, note that you've probably seen `() => {}` to describe a function, but now we're using `msg => {}`. This just means that the function will take a **argument** called `msg` that holds some text that is going to be the message. Inside the function, we:

-   Use `let toast = document.createElement("div");` to create a `<div>` element. `toast` is how we're going to refer to this element.
-   We add a class (a set of styles in CSS) called `.toast`. These are the styles we wrote before, in Step One.

*   We set the HTML inside the `<div>` to a paragraph tag. The text inside the paragraph tag is `msg`, which is done using `${msg}`. (In fact, this is why we use backticks instead of `""` marks - so that we can include data inside the text.)
*   Finally, we add the toast to `<div id="toasts">`. CSS takes care of the sliding up and disappearing animation, as we saw before.

And now, toasts should work! Let's try it out.

### Get share button working

Getting the share button working is quite easy. These lines of code need to be added to the bottom of the code inside `window.onload`:

```javascript
document.getElementById("share-button").addEventListener("click", () => {
    navigator.clipboard.writeText("https://holiday2022.cchs.hackclub.com");
    createNewToast("Copied to clipboard");
});
```

First, we get the `<button id="share-button">`, which you'll notice we created before in Step One. Then, we add an **event listener** to it that checks when the button is clicked. When it's click, we run a function (the `() => {}`) that does two things:

1. `navigator.clipboard.writeText("https://holiday2022.cchs.hackclub.com");` copies the link, `https://holiday2022.cchs.hackclub.com`, to the clipboard.
2. `createNewToast("Copied to clipboard")` creates a new toast using the function that we created before, with the message/text inside the toast being "Copied to clipboard".

### Get the form working

Now let's get the form working! To do this, we'll need to write some JavaScript. Let's open up `index.js`.

There are two parts:

1. Getting the signatures when the page loads
2. Uploading a signature when the user fits out the form

Let's deal with #1 first. To do it, we're going to write a **function** - a block of code. It will look like this, at the top of the file:

```javascript
const getSignatures = () => {
    document.getElementById("signatures").innerHTML = "";
    fetch("https://www.jianminchen.com/api/various/holiday2022")
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(json => {
            if (json.success) {
                const signaturesContainer =
                    document.getElementById("signatures");
                for (let signature of json.signatures) {
                    let p = document.createElement("p");
                    p.innerText = signature;
                    p.style.transform = `rotate(${Math.floor(
                        Math.random() * (15 - -15 + 1) - 15
                    )}deg)`;
                    signaturesContainer.appendChild(p);
                }
            }
        });
};
```

Let's go through this line by line. Our block of code is called `getSignatures`. Inside it, we get the `<div>` with `id="signatures"`, which basically holds all the signatures, and clear it out by setting the HTML inside it to empty.

Then, we have `fetch("https://www.jianminchen.com/api/various/holiday2022")`. This gets the data at that link. In fact, if you open [https://www.jianminchen.com/api/various/holiday2022](https://www.jianminchen.com/api/various/holiday2022) (try it out!), you get something like this:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "signatures": ["Amanda", "Test"]
}
```

This is JSON - do you remember it from the [intro walkthrough](/walkthroughs/newcomer.mdx)? We have two items: `success` and `signatures`.

-   `success`: If this is `true`, then the website request was successful.
-   `signatures`: This is a list, as represented by the `[]`s. It's a list of signatures/names.

However this is actually just text. For it to become JSON, we have to run `.then(res => res.json())`, which converts the result into JSON.

Once we have the JSON, we can check if `json.success` is `true`. `if (json.success)` is short for `if (json.success === true)` (`===` is the equal to operator).

If the request was successful, we're going to get `<div id="signatures">` again. Then, we're going to go through every signature inside `json.signatures` with `for (let signature of json.signatures)`, which is a `for` loop and goes through each item in a list, with `signature` being the current signature. For each signature:

-   We use `let p = document.createElement("p")` to create a `p` tag.
-   We use `p.innerText = signature` to change the text inside the `p` tag to the current signature.
-   We use <code>p.style.transform = `rotate(${Math.floor(Math.random() * (15 - -15 + 1) - 15)}deg)`;</code> to rotate the signature randomly. This is equal to `transform: rotate()` in CSS, but we are doing it with JavaScript, using [random number generation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4959975/generate-random-number-between-two-numbers-in-javascript) to generate a degree between -15 and 15. This makes the signatures uniquely rotated everytime you refresh the page!

Finally, we add the current signature to `<div id="signatures">`, so it actually shows up.

Of course, _this is just a block of code, so we need to "call" it for it to actually run_. Let's add this to the top of the code inside `window.onload`:

```javascript
getSignatures();
```

Notice that this is the name of the function.

And now the current signatures should show up! Now let's deal with #2: uploading a signature when the user fills out the form. This code goes in `window.onload` at the bottom:

```javascript
document.getElementById("sign").addEventListener("submit", event => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const name = event.target.name.value;
    if (!name) createNewToast("Please enter a name!");
    else {
        // Upload name to database
        fetch("https://www.jianminchen.com/api/various/holiday2022", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
                "Accept": "application/json",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({ name })
        })
            .then(res => res.json())
            .then(json => {
                if (json.error) createNewToast(json.error);
                else {
                    getSignatures();
                    createNewToast(
                        "Awesome! Now send this card off to someone!"
                    );
                }
            })
            .catch(err => createNewToast(err));
    }
});
```

Here, we're getting `<div id="sign">`, and adding an event listener to check when it's submitted. When it gets submitted, we're going to use `event.preventDefault()` to prevent the default event from happening (which is that the page gets reloaded). Then, we get the name using `const name = event.target.name.value`. If you look at the `input` element we created before for entering the name, you'll notice that it has a `name="name"`. This allows us to use `event.target.name.value`, which gets the form input that has `name="name"` and its value.

If the user didn't put in a name, we let them know by creating a toast with "Please enter a name!"

Otherwise, if the user did upload a name, we can upload the name to the database. Like before, we're using `fetch("https://www.jianminchen.com/api/various/holiday2022")`, but this time, we're passing in the form data using:

```javascript
{
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ name })
}
```

This is also JSON. The method we use to upload to the database is `POST`. When we asked for the names, we used a `GET` request. When we upload, we use a `POST` request. This is explained more in detail [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

We also pass some headers. These are a bit confusing, so I won't get into it too much, but just know that it describes the passed data as JSON.

Finally, the body, or content that is passed, is just the name. When we transfer data, everything has to be text, so we use JSON.stringify to convert the JSON, which is `{ name }` (sort for `{ name: name }`), into text.

Once we pass this data, we wait for a response. When we get a response, we convert it to JSON like we did before. But instead of checking if `json.success === true`, we check if `json.error === true`. If it is true, that means there was an error, so we'll create a new toast that tells the user the error message. Otherwise, we can refresh the signatures on the card so the user can see their signature, and also create a toast telling them to send the card to someone.

That's all! Now you can sign the card, which is super cool.

## Conclusion

Wooh, now everything should work! Try clicking on "Run" and opening the site in a new tab. You should get the same result as the video.

-   If something is not working: right click on the page > Inspect > Console, which will tell you if any errors happened. Try and figure out what's wrong; if you need help, call me!
-   If something is not styled right, try and figure out why, before calling me.

### Emailing

**Note: Once we've got the card working, I'm going to deploy it to [holiday2022.cchs.hackclub.com](https://holiday2022.cchs.hackclub.com), and then you guys can send the link to people.**

Now for the fun part: let's send this card off to some people! Email the link to some people you want to send a card to, and ask them to sign the form and then share the card with someone else. Theoretically, if everybody shares the card with someone else, the signatures will keep growing!

### What we haven't done

There are always things to add. For me, one of the biggest things is [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries), which is CSS that changes depending on the size and kind of device you're on. If you look at this card on a phone, it's probably going to look weird, but that's because we haven't written any media queries yet.
